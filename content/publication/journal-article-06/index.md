# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "This paper investigates households’ extrapolative behaviors and developers’ responses in China’s land and housing markets. Our stylized model predicts that when households extrapolate in the housing market, developers with nearby land stocks strategically bid higher, capitalizing on households’ mistakes. Leveraging the exogeneity of land auctions’ dates, we show that higher land premiums lead to increased transaction prices and volumes of nearby houses. Furthermore, developers with land stocks near the auctioned land paid higher premiums. We implement various tests and exploit a policy reform to rule out alternative explanations to support the notion of developers manipulating homebuyers’ behaviors."
